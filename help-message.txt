🆘 Need Help: Casper APIs & CORS Issues

Hey everyone! 👋

I'm building StakeVue, a liquid staking dApp for the Casper 2025 Hackathon. I'm running into some technical issues with data access and would really appreciate your advice.

🔴 Problem 1: CORS Blocked

My frontend can't directly call Casper APIs due to CORS restrictions. I get this error:

Access to fetch at 'https://event-store-api-clarity-mainnet.make.services/...' from origin 'https://stakevue.vercel.app' has been blocked by CORS policy

Current workaround: I'm using Vercel serverless functions as a proxy:
Frontend → /api/validators (Vercel) → make.services API

It works but it's not ideal. Is there an official API with CORS enabled?

🔴 Problem 2: Inconsistent Data

The make.services API returns data that doesn't match cspr.live:

| Data                | make.services API | cspr.live  |
|---------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Active Validators   | 100               | 88         |
| Rankings            | Different         | Correct    |
| Self-stake values   | Approximate       | Accurate   |

Questions:
1. Which API is the most reliable/up-to-date for validator data?
2. Does cspr.live have a public API we can use?
3. Is there a recommended RPC endpoint for accurate network stats?

🔴 Problem 3: Missing Data

I couldn't find any API for:
- Top delegators list (individual stakers)
- TVL historical data
- Historical staking data

Do we need a custom indexer for this?

🛠️ What I'm Currently Using

- Validators: https://event-store-api-clarity-mainnet.make.services/validators
- CSPR Price: https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/casper-network/market_chart

🙏 What I Need

1. API with CORS to call directly from frontend
2. Accurate validator data (count, rankings, self-stake)
3. Delegators endpoint if it exists
4. Advice on the best approach for a hackathon project

Thanks in advance for your help!
